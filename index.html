            <h2>Father</h2>
            <p>He was my steadfast anchor in the storm, the silent strength that held me up when I faltered. In his eyes, I found unwavering belief and endless love, a beacon that guided me through my darkest days. Though his presence is a bittersweet echo, his legacy of warmth and wisdom continues to light up my heart with every step I take.</p>
